# CRISPR

**Cyber-risk quantification and security investment decision support for Indian enterprises**

CRISPR is a Smart India Hackathon prototype for **Problem Statement ID 26105**. It brings findings from security tools into one asset-aware risk picture, estimates financial exposure in Indian rupees, explains the drivers behind each risk, simulates control changes, and recommends a security portfolio for a given budget.

## SIH 2026 Presentation - Team: P0werh0usE

Our Smart India Hackathon 2026 presentation covers the CRISPR solution, technical architecture, FAIR-based financial risk engine, AI investment optimization, feasibility, impact, and references.

Experience the live CRISPR prototype running on AWS:

[🔗 Open Live Prototype](https://crispr-hosting.vercel.app/login)

The prototype demonstrates how CRISPR converts technical cybersecurity findings into **₹-denominated financial risk** and helps security teams prioritize and optimize remediation decisions.

### What You Can Explore

- **Financial Risk Quantification** - Convert vulnerability and asset data into Expected Annual Loss (EAL)
- **Asset-Weighted Risk Scoring** - Prioritize risks using business and asset criticality rather than CVSS alone
- **Risk Prioritization** - Identify which vulnerabilities create the greatest financial exposure
- **AI Investment Optimization** - Determine the most effective security controls within a defined ₹ budget
- **What-If Scenario Analysis** - Evaluate how security decisions affect financial exposure
- **Natural Language Risk Queries** - Ask questions about organizational cyber risk in business language
- **Compliance Mapping** - Connect findings with relevant cybersecurity and regulatory frameworks
- **Executive Financial View** - Present cyber risk in a format suitable for management and decision-makers

> **Prototype:** The live environment is intended for demonstration and evaluation of the CRISPR financial-risk workflow.

The included fictional organization is **NovaPay Financial Services**, an Indian fintech used only for demonstration.

## Why CRISPR

Security teams often receive isolated alerts from scanners, bug-bounty programs, EDR/XDR, SIEM, IAM, threat intelligence, cloud tools, and asset inventories. Technical severity alone does not show which issue creates the greatest business loss.

CRISPR turns that fragmented evidence into a decision workflow:

```text
Security findings
      ↓
Normalize and correlate by asset
      ↓
Add business criticality and control posture
      ↓
Estimate likelihood and loss magnitude
      ↓
Expected Annual Loss (EAL) in ₹
      ↓
Explain drivers, forecast risk, test scenarios
      ↓
Optimize security investment
```

## Demo Story

The strongest demonstration is the **Authentication API (`A003`)**:

- Corroborated by Bug Bounty, Vulnerability Scanner, XDR, and IAM evidence.
- Evidence confidence is capped at **94%**.
- Business criticality is **96/100**.
- Control posture includes only **58% MFA coverage**.
- Annual incident frequency comes from explicit evidence (or a clearly labelled SIH demo assumption); the CVE model is used only for exploitation prioritization.
- Loss magnitude is **₹3.80 crore**.
- Expected Annual Loss is **₹79.8 lakh**.
- Risk score is **87/100**.

The contrasting **Test Server (`A006`)** has CVSS 9.8 but low business criticality and only **₹3 lakh EAL**, demonstrating that technical severity is not the same as business risk.

Demo figures are calculated from bundled fixtures and are labeled as demo data.
Live figures are calculated only from persisted, organization-scoped evidence;
missing evidence produces an explicit error instead of fixture substitution.

## Implemented Capabilities

### Data ingestion and connectors

- PostgreSQL-backed, idempotent ingestion for assets and findings.
- Explicit demo-fixture mode; live mode fails closed when PostgreSQL or evidence is unavailable.
- Connectors for Bug Bounty, Vulnerability Scanner, EDR, XDR, SIEM, IAM, Threat Intelligence, CSPM, and CMDB.
- Source status, per-asset findings, and cross-source grouping APIs.
- Accepted live bug-bounty reports become normalized findings automatically.

### Correlation and asset intelligence

- Pydantic-based unified finding schema.
- Severity normalization and finding deduplication helpers.
- Asset-based correlation and source-diversity confidence scoring.
- Business criticality scoring from operational and regulatory context.
- Weighted control-effectiveness scoring for MFA, EDR, WAF, patching, segmentation, and logging.

### Risk and financial quantification

- Deterministic likelihood calculation.
- India-specific downtime and regulatory cost inputs.
- Loss breakdown across downtime, incident response, recovery, data breach, regulatory, and reputation costs.
- Evidence-backed Expected Annual Loss and seeded Monte Carlo P95/P99 VaR.
- Explainable positive and negative risk drivers.

### AI and ML

- Natural-language intent routing for risk, scenario, optimization, forecast, and anomaly questions.
- General cybersecurity question answering with bounded model fallbacks.
- Financial-number guardrail: LLM-generated rupee claims must exist in deterministic engine data.
- Checksum-verified XGBoost CVE prioritization with governed runtime validation.
- Isolation Forest detection of unusual failed-login rates.
- Deterministic 90-day linear EAL forecast.
- Real TreeSHAP explanations computed against the deployed XGBoost model.

### Decision support

- MFA, emergency patching, segmentation, EDR expansion, and patch-delay simulations.
- Dynamic marginal-benefit optimizer that recomputes overlapping control effects.
- Compliance mapping for ISO 27001, NIST CSF, CIS Controls, RBI CSF, and SEBI CSCRF.
- Control costs, risk reduction, remaining budget, and ROSI output.

### User applications

- Executive security and financial-risk dashboard.
- Risk, asset, finding, scenario, investment, compliance, identity, threat-intelligence, and integration views.
- AI Risk Advisor available from the application shell and dashboards.
- Separate authenticated bug-bounty portal for reporters and security reviewers.
- Separate animated product-tour prototype under `crispr_products/`.

### Docker services

The repository has one `docker-compose.yml` that starts the complete stack. Services intentionally use separate containers rather than placing PostgreSQL and web processes in one container.

| Service | Image/build | Host port | Purpose |
|---|---|---:|---|
| `frontend` | Multi-stage React + Nginx build | 5173 | Main CRISPR dashboard |
| `bug-bounty` | Multi-stage React + Nginx build | 3000 | Researcher and triage portal |
| `backend` | Python 3.11 + FastAPI | 8000 | APIs, engines, AI and ML runtime |
| `db` | PostgreSQL 15 | Internal only | Users, reports, assets and findings |

Both Nginx containers proxy `/api/*` to the backend, so browser deployments can use same-origin API requests.

## Quick Start with Docker

For a guided, idempotent installation that prompts for required and optional
credentials, run:

```bash
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

See [the complete installation walkthrough](docs/deployment/setup.md) for
live-data prerequisites, backup behavior, verification, and troubleshooting.

For a single Vercel Services deployment containing the main Vite dashboard,
native FastAPI backend, and Neon PostgreSQL, see the
[Vercel deployment guide](docs/deployment/vercel.md). PostgreSQL and Neo4j must
use managed storage, and the long-running worker needs an always-on host or a
Vercel Queues migration; Vercel does not run `docker-compose.yml` directly.

### Prerequisites

- Docker Engine or Docker Desktop
- Docker Compose v2 (`docker compose`)
- Ports `3000`, `5173`, and `8000` available

### 1. Configure environment variables

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and replace all placeholders. The AI Advisor can run deterministic templates without an LLM, but general AI answers and polished explanations require an OpenAI-compatible endpoint.

```dotenv
AUTH_SECRET=replace-with-a-long-random-secret
SECURITY_ADMIN_EMAIL=security@example.com
SECURITY_ADMIN_PASSWORD=replace-with-a-long-random-password

LLM_ENABLED=true
LLM_BASE_URL=https://your-compatible-endpoint.example.com/v1
LLM_API_KEY=replace-with-your-api-key
```

The repository-root `.env` is ignored by Git. Never put real credentials in `.env.example`, source files, Dockerfiles, or commits.

### 2. Start the complete application

```bash
docker compose up --build -d
```

Docker waits for PostgreSQL and the backend health check before starting both frontends.

### 3. Open the applications

- Main dashboard: <http://localhost:5173>
- Bug-bounty portal: <http://localhost:3000>
- FastAPI documentation: <http://localhost:8000/docs>
- OpenAPI schema: <http://localhost:8000/openapi.json>
- Health check: <http://localhost:8000/api/health>

### 4. Inspect or stop the stack

```bash
docker compose ps
docker compose logs -f backend
docker compose down
```

PostgreSQL data is retained in the `crispr_postgres_data` volume. To remove all local database state:

```bash
docker compose down -v
```

## Local Demo Authentication

The Docker configuration creates a local security-team account if it does not already exist:

```text
Email:    security@novapay.com
Password: NovaPay-Security-2026
```

These credentials are for local demonstration only. Override them in `.env` before any shared or public deployment.

Researchers register their own `REPORTER` accounts in the bug-bounty portal. Security users can view all reports, review submissions, and trigger ingestion refreshes. Reporter users can only view their own reports.

## Data Pipeline

At backend startup:

1. PostgreSQL tables and indexes are created if required.
2. The default security user is created if absent.
3. `data/demo/assets.json` is upserted by `asset_id`.
4. Source findings are upserted by `finding_id`.
5. Connectors read PostgreSQL first and use JSON fallback on database failure.

Seed datasets:

| File | Source | Records |
|---|---|---:|
| `assets.json` | CMDB asset inventory | 20 |
| `bug_bounty.json` | Bug Bounty | 11 |
| `vulnerabilities.json` | Vulnerability Scanner | 11 |
| `edr_events.json` | EDR | 10 |
| `xdr_events.json` | XDR | 10 |
| `siem_events.json` | SIEM | 10 |
| `iam.json` | IAM | 10 |
| `threat_intel.json` | Threat Intelligence | 10 |

The CSPM connector supports an optional `data/demo/cspm.json`. It reports `disconnected` when that file is absent. CMDB reports asset-inventory status rather than producing security findings.

Manual refresh:

```bash
docker compose exec backend python backend/ingestion/seed.py
```

## Risk Methodology

### Business criticality

Business criticality is a 0–100 weighted score:

```text
30% asset criticality
20% data sensitivity
20% revenue dependency
15% regulatory scope
15% internet exposure
```

### Control effectiveness

```text
25% MFA coverage
20% EDR coverage
20% patch compliance
15% WAF
15% segmentation
 5% logging coverage
```

The prototype caps control effectiveness at 95%.

### Likelihood

```text
25% normalized CVSS
20% exploit availability
15% patch age
15% internet exposure
15% control weakness
10% active threat intelligence
```

### Financial loss

```text
Loss magnitude = downtime
               + incident response
               + recovery
               + data breach
               + regulatory
               + reputation

EAL = organization-supplied annual incident probability × loss magnitude
Monte Carlo VaR = percentile of simulated annual portfolio loss
```

Live loss components and annual frequency must be supplied from approved
organization evidence. The ML artifact predicts calibrated KEV membership and
is used for prioritization only; it is excluded from EAL.

## Scenario and Investment Models

Scenario values are recomputed from ingested findings, asset loss inputs, and
control posture; there are no calibrated target reductions. Missing findings are
excluded and counted in `calculation_scope`. Patch-delay exposure is compounded
with the formula returned in each response.

The optimizer dynamically recomputes marginal loss-exposure reduction after
each selected control and enforces a configurable minimum marginal ROSI. Control
costs remain planning assumptions until replaced with approved internal/vendor
estimates, and the response says so explicitly.

Production defaults to `CRISPR_DATA_MODE=live`, which reads only rows marked
`data_origin=LIVE` and returns HTTP 503 when required data is missing. Set
`CRISPR_DATA_MODE=demo` only for tests or a clearly labelled presentation.

## AI Risk Advisor

The advisor follows a grounded pipeline:

```text
Question
  ↓
Deterministic keyword intent
  ↓
In-process tool call to risk/scenario/optimizer engine
  ↓
Template answer containing engine facts
  ↓
Optional LLM explanation
  ↓
Financial-number guardrail
```

The LLM is an explanation layer, not the source of financial truth. Every rupee amount in a model-generated risk answer must match a value contained in the deterministic tool data; otherwise the response falls back to the deterministic template.

Supported demo questions include:

- “What is our highest financial cyber risk?”
- “Why is the Auth API high risk?”
- “What happens if we implement MFA?”
- “What if we delay patching by 30 days?”
- “What should we do with ₹1 crore?”
- “Show the 90-day risk forecast.”
- “Are there suspicious failed logins?”
- General cybersecurity questions such as “What is IDOR?”

When `LLM_ENABLED=false` or the model service is unavailable, deterministic risk answers continue to work.

## ML Prototype Modules

| Module | Current implementation | Training status |
|---|---|---|
| CVE exploitation prioritization | Calibrated XGBoost KEV-membership classifier | Trained artifact; runtime validation required |
| Anomaly detection | Isolation Forest over synthetic failed-login-rate features derived from SIEM demo signals | Runtime unsupervised fit |
| Forecasting | Linear EAL drift at 0.77% per day, default 90-day horizon | Not trained |
| Explainability | Contribution ranking in a SHAP-compatible display shape | Rule-based V1 |

Runtime dependencies are in `requirements.txt`. Future XGBoost, pandas, and SHAP experimentation uses:

```bash
pip install -r requirements-ml-v2.txt
```

## Frontend Coverage

The main React dashboard defaults to live API mode. Its API abstraction returns demo fixtures if an optional endpoint is unavailable so the hackathon interface remains navigable.

### Live or substantially connected

- Security and financial dashboards
- Findings and source status
- Assets, controls and risk cases
- Risks and risk drivers
- Scenarios and presets
- Investments and control catalogue
- Compliance and gaps
- AI Advisor, forecast and anomaly APIs
- Identity MFA summaries
- Threat-intelligence finding list
- Integration connection-status display

### Prototype or fixture-backed areas

- Attack-path graph generation
- Code repositories, SAST, SCA/SBOM, secrets and IaC scanning
- Cloud/CSPM findings while `cspm.json` is absent
- Privileged-identity inventory beyond asset-level MFA data
- Threat actors and campaigns
- Remediation workflow and assignments
- Policies and policy evaluation
- Report generation/export
- Persistent settings, organizations and API keys
- Integration connect/reconnect/disable operations
- Historical dashboard trend series

The API Reference screen also shows planned `/api/repositories`, `/api/integrations`, and `/api/analysis/run` routes that are not implemented by the current backend.

## Local Development without Full Compose

### Backend

For the complete database-backed backend during frontend development:

```bash
docker compose up -d db backend
```

For a native Python run using the JSON fallback:

```bash
python3.11 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
LLM_ENABLED=false uvicorn backend.app.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

The native fallback supports public connector and risk APIs. Authentication, live ingestion control, and bug-bounty workflows require a reachable PostgreSQL instance; use the Docker backend unless you have configured a local `DATABASE_URL`.

### Main dashboard

```bash
cd frontend
npm ci
npm run dev
```

For a Vite development server, set `VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000` because the production Nginx reverse proxy is not present.

### Bug-bounty portal

```bash
cd bug-bounty
npm install
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000 npm run dev -- --port 3000
```

### Animated product tour

`crispr_products/` is a separate TanStack Start/React 19 presentation prototype. It is fixture-driven and is **not** part of the root Docker Compose stack or the source of live platform figures.

```bash
cd crispr_products
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Testing and Validation

Run the backend suite inside the integrated environment:

```bash
docker compose exec backend pytest backend/tests -q
```

Current suite coverage focuses on the scenario engine, optimizer, compliance mapper, and their API routes.

Build both frontend applications:

```bash
cd frontend && npm ci && npm run build
cd ../bug-bounty && npm install && npm run build
```

Useful smoke tests:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/health
curl http://localhost:8000/api/risks/enterprise
curl http://localhost:8000/api/scenarios/presets
curl http://localhost:8000/api/compliance
```

## PostgreSQL

The database contains:

- `users`: PBKDF2-SHA256 password hashes and `REPORTER`/`SECURITY` roles.
- `bug_bounty_reports`: report content, ownership, status, and review metadata.
- `assets`: JSONB asset payloads keyed by `asset_id`.
- `findings`: JSONB source payloads with indexed source and asset columns.

Open a PostgreSQL shell without exposing port 5432 to the host:

```bash
docker compose exec db psql -U crispr -d crispr
```

See the [documentation index](docs/README.md) and the detailed
[project structure guide](docs/development/project-structure.md) before adding
new modules.

## Security Notes

Before any non-local deployment:

- Replace every default secret and password.
- Restrict CORS instead of allowing all origins.
- Terminate TLS at a trusted reverse proxy or load balancer.
- Use a managed identity provider and managed secret storage.
- Add rate limiting, audit logging, account lockout, and CSRF protections where applicable.
- Keep PostgreSQL private and back it up.
- Validate and sanitize uploaded or externally sourced connector data.
- Review model endpoint data-handling requirements before sending security context externally.

See [`docs/deployment/aws.md`](docs/deployment/aws.md) for the current AWS deployment walkthrough.

## Current Limitations

- Exact historical ML holdout rows and a training-distribution reference profile
  are not shipped, so historical metric reproduction and statistical drift remain
  `NOT_ASSESSABLE`.
- The XGBoost target is CISA KEV membership; it is approved for prioritization,
  not direct annual-frequency prediction.
- Live EAL requires organization-approved frequency and loss evidence for every
  calculated finding and asset.
- Scenario control-effect formulas are disclosed planning assumptions and require
  organization-specific validation before investment decisions.
- Only the GitHub platform connector currently implements a complete external
  credential verification and background synchronization workflow.
- Forecasting remains a deterministic planning projection rather than a trained
  forecasting model.
